I built a quickly development platform, based on bower and gulp. A html template system oriented to components development.

# Elements installation

Install NodeJS by downloading it here

Install Gulp `sudo npm install -g gulp`

Install all the npm dependencies you need for Gulp from within your project folder. `npm install`

Install `Bower sudo npm install -g bower`

Install all the Bower dependencies you'll need. `bower install`

All done! You can now `gulp`
